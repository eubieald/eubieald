Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Eubie , and I find joy in the world of programming, chess, and music. When I'm not immersed in code, you'll likely find me plotting my next move on the chessboard or strumming the strings of my bass guitar, playing melodies that resonate with my soul.

One of my greatest passions is the art of programming. I love the thrill of solving problems, building applications, and the endless possibilities that technology opens up. It's not just a career; it's a journey of constant learning and exploration.


- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working as a full-stack developer in the near future.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, Webpack, MERN and other tech stack.
